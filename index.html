            <p> This Web Application is based on the concept of n-grams, which is widely used for natural language processing, signal processing,
                 and bioinformatics. 
                n−gram is simply a sub-string of size n built from a given input character string. For example, we can break down
                the string “abcdef” into four 3−grams: “abc”, “bcd”, “cde” and “def”. 
                In order to compare two texts, we break each one of them into n−grams and count how often these n−grams
                appear in each text.  This results in two vectors of frequencies, a vector for each text. Clearly, two identical texts 
                will have identical frequency vectors. 
                As more and more changes are made to any of the texts, the associated frequency
                vectors will change. The more changes there are, the more these vectors will be different.
                This approach has several advantages.  In particular, in relation to other measures to compare texts, the measures
                that are based on the concept of n−grams are generally faster. In addition, these approaches are very robust to
                permutations. The inversion of lines or paragraphs has little effect on the calculated similarity score. This makes
                these methods robust. Finally, since an n−gram can run across the boundary between two consecutive words in the
                text, the n−grams indirectly inform us about the co-occurrence of terms (when two words occur frequently together
                in a text).
